# PIXPIX
### The purpose of the project ###
This project is currently working for the autonomous landing of a quadrotor drone.

### Construction of an environment ###
This project is based on the original simulation environment of the pixhawk firmware.
And modify the model to make it quilify for the project so the hils can work.
Just create any gazebo world that key points are recognizable and run with the openaihawk

## Why utility ##
The previous control algorithm for drone landing is highly based on additional sensors and devices which make the drone got heavy
It is certainly forbidden that makes the drone heavy, and it's because the drone is not that efficient so the small amount of mass could affect quite a lot on movements of it

But there is a hope that it makes the autonomous landing easier when it is with AI

Will see
